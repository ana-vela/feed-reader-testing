# Feed Reader Testing

## Project Overview

This is the fourth project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. The task was to create a series of test suites for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), a JavaScript testing framework, students were given a list of tests that should be passed:

* All feeds should be defined.
* URLs and feed names should be defined and not empty.
* The menu element should be hidden by default.
* The menu element should be able to toggle from hidden to visible when clicked.
* Feeds should be unique.

## Running the App

Fork or download this repo to access the tests. Open the index.html file in your favorite browser. The test suites and individual tests will be listed at the bottom of the page.
